## CompeteViewer
CompeteViewer is a flutter based cross platform app, It helps to view contestants in a social media based competition (competitions where winners are declared according to most number of likes, comments and shares) sorted by their total points, contestant number or any other criteria.

Currently the formula is hardcoded ((fbLikes+instaLikes)+(2*(fbComments+instaComments))+(3*fbShares)). Dynamic formula generation will be included in next release.
